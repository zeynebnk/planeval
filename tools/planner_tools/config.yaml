    docstring: >
      Custom editor for planning - can only view files and write to plan.md
      * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
      * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
      * The `write_plan` command writes your implementation plan to /testbed/plan.md. The `path` parameter is ignored for this command.
      * This tool can ONLY write to /testbed/plan.md. It cannot create or modify any other files.
