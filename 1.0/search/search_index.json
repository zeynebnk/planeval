Want to just run it? Jump ahead to the installation or usage sections.</p> <p></p> <p>The central entry point to SWE-agent is the <code>sweagent</code> command line executable (1). It initializes an instance of the <code>SWEEnv</code> class (2) that manages the environment. With SWE-agent 1.0, this class is now merely a thin wrapper around our SWE-ReX package. Upon initialization, <code>SWEEnv</code> initializes the SWE-ReX Deployment. The Deployment either starts a local Docker container (4), or it starts the container on a remote system like modal or aws (3). Within the container, SWE-ReX starts a shell session (5) that will be used to execute the commands. SWE-ReX also installs the ACI elements as custom tools (9) that are available to the shell session.</p> <p>The second class that is initialized by is the <code>Agent</code> (6).

It's most important method is <code>forward()</code> which prompts the model and executes its action.</p> <p>To prompt the model, the history (all prompts to the model together with actions and outputs) need to be sent to the LM. In order to make the best use of the context window of the model, the history gets compressed by a <code>HistoryProcessor</code> (7).

The model name and provider might be arbitrarily chosen for local models.</p> <p>Cost/token limits</p> <p>If you do not disable the default cost limits, you will see an error because the cost calculator will not be able to find the model in the <code>litellm</code> model cost dictionary.</p> <p>You have two options:</p> <ol> <li>Disable cost tracking (recommended for most users): Set <code>per_instance_cost_limit</code> to 0 and use the <code>per_instance_call_limit</code> instead to limit the runtime per issue.</li> <li>Use a custom model registry: If you want to track costs for your local model, you can provide a custom <code>litellm_model_registry</code> file with cost information for your model (see here).</li> </ol> <p>Please also make sure to set <code>max_input_tokens</code> to a non-<code>None</code> value to avoid other warnings.</p> <p>Parsing functions</p> <p>The default config uses function calling to retrieve actions from the model response, i.e., the model directly provides the action as a JSON object. If your model doesn't support function calling, you can use the <code>thought_action</code> parser by setting <code>agent.tools.parse_function.type</code> to <code>thought_action</code>. Then, we extract the last triple-backticks block from the model response as the action. See our API docs for more details on parsers. Remember to document the tools in your prompt as the model will not be able to see the function signature like with function calling.</p> <p>Message types</p> <p>The <code>cache_control</code> history processor requires a different message format (e.g., <code>{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'some text', 'cache_control': {'type': 'ephemeral'}}]}]</code>). This might not be understood by all language models. Therefore, please remove this history processor if you do not need it (it's currently mostly used for anthropic cache control). See #957 for more information.</p>"},{"location":"installation/keys/#something-went-wrong","title":"Something went wrong?","text":"<ul> <li>If you get <code>Error code: 404</code>, please check your configured keys, in particular   whether you set <code>OPENAI_API_BASE_URL</code> correctly (if you're not using it, the   line should be deleted or commented out).

Run <code>sweagent --help</code> to see all options. Splitting up both commands made it easier to make both use cases more convenient and flexible.</li> <li>We have switched to a hierarchical configuration system.

However, if none of them work, we throw an error which then tells you why we cannot initialize any of the types (so it will tell you that <code>github_url</code> is required for <code>GithubIssue</code>, even though you might not even have tried to work on a GitHub issue).</p> <p></p>Example union type errors   Example union type errors<p></p> <p>This is the output of running</p> <pre><code>sweagent run --problem_statement.path=\"test\" --problem_statement.github_url=\"asdf\"\n</code></pre> <p></p><pre><code>\u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502 Validation error                                                                                                  \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 The following errors are raised by Pydantic, trying to instantiate the configuration based on                     \u2502\n\u2502 the merged configuration dictionary (see above).                                                                  \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 Every new indented block corresponds to a different error from Pydantic.                                          \u2502\n\u2502 The first line of each block is the attribute that failed validation, the following lines are the error messages. \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 If you see many lines of errors, there are probably different ways to instantiate the same object (a union type). \u2502\n\u2502 For example, there are different deployments with different options each.

Here, we can simply create an empty folder (outside of the SWE-agent repository), and add a <code>main.py</code> file</p> <pre><code>mkdir empty\ngit init\ntouch main.py\necho \"*.pyc\" &gt; .gitignore  # to avoid binary files in patches\n</code></pre> <p>and potentially populate it with the problem stub</p> <pre><code>from typing import List\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -&gt; int:\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>If some imports (like <code>List</code>) are missing in the problem stub (like they oftentimes do in leetcode) , SWE-agent will figure out how to add them. However, it might take an additional step, so it's best to directly specify them.</p> <p>Make sure to commit all changes to the repository:</p> <pre><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"Add problem stub\"\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can let SWE-agent solve the problem:</p> <pre><code>sweagent run \\\n    --config config/coding_challenge.yaml \\\n    --problem_statement.path=problem.md \\\n    --env.repo.path=/path/to/empty \\\n    --agent.model.name=gpt-4o \\\n    --agent.model.per_instance_cost_limit 3.0 \\\n    --actions.apply_patch_locally=True\n</code></pre> Output <pre><code>2024-07-12 17:57:39,876 INFO \ud83d\udcd9 Arguments: actions:\n  apply_patch_locally: false\n  open_pr: false\n  push_gh_repo_url: ''\n  skip_if_commits_reference_issue: true\nagent:\n  config:\n    _commands:\n    - arguments:\n        line_number:\n          description: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the\n            window will start at the top of the file)\n          required: false\n          type: integer\n        path:\n          description: the path to the file to open\n          required: true\n          type: string\n      code: 'open() {    if [ -z \"$1\" ]    then        echo \"Usage: open &lt;file&gt;\"        return    fi    #\n        Check if the second argument is provided    if [ -n \"$2\" ]; then        #\n        Check if the provided argument is a valid number        if !

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n      Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n      When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n      Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\n\n      NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n      IMPORTANT TIPS:\n      1. Write your solution in main.py. Always test your code thoroughly before submitting, and if any of the tests fail, try to fix the code before continuing.\n\n      2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n      3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n      4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n      5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_no_output_template: |-\n      Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_template: |-\n      {observation}\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    parse_command: {}\n    parse_function: {}\n    put_demos_in_history: false\n    state_command:\n      arguments: null\n      code: |\n        state() {\n          local working_dir=\"$PWD\";\n          if [ -z $CURRENT_FILE ]; then\n              echo '{\"open_file\": \"n/a\", \"working_dir\": \"'$working_dir'\"}';\n          else\n              echo '{\"open_file\": \"'$(realpath $CURRENT_FILE)'\", \"working_dir\": \"'$working_dir'\"}';\n          fi\n        };\n      docstring: null\n      end_name: null\n      name: state\n      signature: null\n    strategy_template: null\n    submit_command: submit\n    subroutine_types: []\n    system_template: |-\n      SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\n      The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.\n      In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\n      COMMANDS:\n      {command_docs}\n\n      Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n      If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n      ```\n      ls -a\n      ```\n\n      You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n      If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,679 INFO DEMONSTRATION: /Users/fuchur/Documents/24/git_sync/SWE-agent/trajectories/demonstrations/human_thought__swe-bench-HumanEvalFix-python__lcb__t-0.00__p-0.95__c-4.00__install-0/humanevalfix-python-0.traj\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,680 INFO Trajectory will be saved to trajectories/fuchur/azure-gpt4__problem__coding_challenge__t-0.00__p-0.95__c-3.00__install-1/26d111.traj\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,747 INFO \ud83e\udd16 MODEL INPUT\nWe're currently attempting to solve the following problem:\nISSUE:\nGiven an unsorted integer array nums.\nReturn the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.\n\nYou must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.\n\n## Example 1:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [1,2,0]\n&gt; Output: 3\n&gt; Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.\n\n## Example 2:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]\n&gt; Output: 2\n&gt; Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.\n\n## Example 3:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]\n&gt; Output: 1\n&gt; Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.\n\n## Constraints:\n\n1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105\n-231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Write your solution in main.py. Always test your code thoroughly before submitting, and if any of the tests fail, try to fix the code before continuing.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /__Users__fuchur__Documents__24__git_sync__empty)\nbash-$\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,042 INFO input_tokens=3,705, output_tokens=48, instance_cost=0.04, cost=0.04\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,044 INFO total_tokens_sent=3,705, total_tokens_received=48, total_cost=0.04, total_api_calls=1\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,045 INFO \ud83d\udcad THOUGHT (primary)\nTo start addressing the issue, I need to access the main.py file where I will implement the solution for the given problem.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the &lt;pr_description&gt;\n            2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python &lt;filename.py&gt;` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n            4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n            5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n            Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\ud83e\udd20 INFO     ========================= STEP 1 =========================\n\ud83e\udd16 DEBUG    n_cache_control: 1\n\ud83e\udd16 INFO     Response: ModelResponse(id='chatcmpl-e4e139ba-eeb0-42cc-a764-ce3dd3cfd953', created=1746538400, model='claude-3-7-sonnet-latest', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None,\n            choices=[Choices(finish_reason='tool_calls', index=0, message=Message(content=\"I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the SyntaxError in the repository.

At the top level, there are three important sections:</p> <ul> <li><code>problem_statement</code>: What problem are you trying to solve?</li> <li><code>agent</code>: How do you want to solve the problem? This includes setting up the LM with <code>--agent.model</code>.</li> <li><code>env</code>: What is the environment in which the problem statement should be solved?   This includes setting the repository/folder with the source files with <code>--env.repo</code>, as well as docker images and other dependencies.   This will also control where the code is executed (in a local container or in the cloud).</li> </ul> <p>Watching the output, you can notice several stages:</p> <ol> <li>Setting up the deployment: SWE-agent lets LMs execute actions in sandboxed environments. It can run these environments    in docker containers (default), on modal, AWS fargate, or directly on your computer (not recommended).    When the deployment starts, you will notice a \"starting runtime\" message that takes a few seconds. The runtime is    what is executing the commands within your deployment.    Deployments are managed by a package called <code>SWE-ReX</code>.</li> <li>Setting up tools: The tools that you specified are copied and installed within the environment.</li> <li>System and instance prompts: The initial instructions are shown to the LM. They are fully configurable.</li> <li>Main loop: The LM starts to suggest and execute actions.</li> <li>Submission: The LM calls <code>submit</code> and we extract the patch (i.e., the changes to the source code that solve the problem).</li> </ol> <p>The complete details of the run are saved as a \"trajectory\" file). They can also be turned into new demonstrations together with other log and output files.</p> <p>Wetted your appetite?

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\\n   Then start trying to fix it.\\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n   \\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\\\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\\\") command at the end of the file,\\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \\n   \\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \\\"buggy-input.png\\\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \\n\\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\\n   \\n\\n(Open file: n/a)\\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\\nbash-$\",\n            \"agent\": \"primary\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"message_type\": \"action\",\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": \"Let's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.
